##General Information
This program is a fully-immersive developer training program that has been successful for dozens of programmers hired at Coding Avenue. The work that will be completed in this program follows the same flow and uses the same tools that you would encounter in the workplace. At each step of the program, you will be receive various forms of support and ultimately have your code reviewed and tested as it is done on-the-job. You will also undergo an interview, much like a job interview, to assess your knowledge and prepare you for your first job.

##Who is the training program for?
The training program is designed for fresh graduates, enthusiasts, and developers-to-be. Ideal applicants are curious and passionate people who want to thrive in the programming industry. These individuals also show high degrees of initiative and self-motivation. According to Larry Wall, the three virtues of a programmer are **Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris**. We tend to believe this is true.

At the very least, trainees should at least:
  * Posess a basic understanding of computer hardware.
  * Demonstrate basic typing skills (35wpm or higher).
  * Be comfortable using the Internet for research.
  * Have a passion for technology and learning.
  * Be willing to dedicate a minimum of 4 hours per day to training.
  * Demonstrate knowledge of common tools: word processors, email, social networking, etc.

##How long does the training last?
Training lasts for 3-4 months. One can expect to spend at minimum, 4 hours per day on the assignments here. Time spent independently researching and learning is not included.

##What will I learn?
Trainees will learn a variety of technology and skills and how to use these skills together. The list includes, but is not limited to OOP, PHP, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Linux, JavaScript/jQuery, HTTP, HTML, CSS, various PHP frameworks, project management, debugging, and optimization techniques. Most importantly, you will learn to think critically and cultivate a growth mindset.

At the end of this program you will be equipped with entry-level programming skills and the ability to advance them.

##Training Program Structure
Each week of the training program is structured roughly as follows:
  1. Read chapter materials according to the Training Timeline. Do research, practice, and aim to understand. Begin chapter assignments if you are able to.
  2. We will meet to discuss the training materials previously read. This time will be spent getting one-on-one help and improving your understanding.
  3. Continue studying the material and complete the chapter assignments. You will submit them for review using Jira.
  4. When you’re ready, schedule an interview to assess your understanding of a chapter’s material.
  5. Upon completion of each chapter you will provide feedback regarding the instruction and guidance you received. This feedback will be used to improve the training materials.
 
The training materials provided or referenced here are by no means all-inclusive. They do not provide in-depth information about any single topic, but serve as introductory guides so that you can learn on your own. Do research on each topic, ask questions when you need to, and find good books to supplement your learning. Much of this program requires self-study. To succeed in this program, you must ask questions, think critically, and persevere.
