#Support
Help and support for the training materials are provided through the following mediums. The support provided is roughly analogous to the kind of support you would receive from your team while actually working as a programmer.
  * Google, Stack Overflow, IRC, etc. These should be your first stop.
  * Collaboration with other trainees. You may contact them directly or email trainees@codingavenue.com
  * You can receive support from Coding Avenue’s dev team by emailing dev+traineesupport@codingavenue.com
  * You can receive help from your mentor by asking for help via the relevant Jira ticket

When sending a request help, follow these guidelines and information requirements:
  * What are you trying to do?
  * Why are you trying to do it? Be sure you’re not experiencing an XY problem: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem
  * What exactly is the error?
  * What else have you tried to do?
  * Include a simple test case or code sample
  * Provide links to whatever training material, code, or other resources that are relevant. This includes pull request, chapter references, etc.
  * Make it easy for a mentor to quickly respond to your inquiries.
  * Assume that your audience has no idea what you’re working on, so provide adequate context.

Be cautious about immediately relying on your team for support, attempt to solve problems on your own and do not deprive yourself of the learning experience. Developers must often rely on research, documentation, and experimentation. Repetition is the road to mastery.
